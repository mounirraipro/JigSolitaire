        q: 'Is JigSolitaire really free?',
        a: 'Yes! JigSolitaire is 100% free to play. No downloads, no accounts, no hidden paywalls. Just open your browser and start solving puzzles.',
    },
    {
        q: 'What devices can I play on?',
        a: 'JigSolitaire works on any modern browser — desktop, tablet, or mobile. The game automatically adapts to your screen size for the best experience.',
    },
    {
        q: 'How does tile merging work?',
        a: 'When two or more adjacent tiles are both in their correct positions, they automatically merge into a group. Merged groups move together when dragged, making the puzzle easier as you progress.',
    },
    {
        q: 'How many levels are there?',
        a: 'JigSolitaire currently features 25 levels across 5 categories (Animals, Nature, Cities, Art, and Food). Each category has 5 levels with increasing difficulty.',
    },
    {
        q: 'What does the difficulty progression look like?',
        a: 'Early levels use a 3×3 grid (9 tiles). As you advance, the grid grows — 4×3, 4×4, and beyond — adding more tiles and complexity to the puzzle.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Can I play offline?',
        a: 'JigSolitaire requires an internet connection to load images and game assets. Once loaded, gameplay is smooth even on slower connections.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Is my progress saved?',
        a: 'Currently, progress is not saved between sessions. We\'re working on adding progress tracking in a future update.',
    },
    {
        q: 'Is JigSolitaire safe for children?',
        a: 'Yes! JigSolitaire contains no violent or inappropriate content. It\'s a great way for kids to develop spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills. We also don\'t collect personal information from children.',
