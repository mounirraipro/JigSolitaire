                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    JigSolitaire was born from a simple idea: what if the relaxing satisfaction of jigsaw puzzles
                    could be combined with the strategic tile-swapping of solitaire? The result is a game that&apos;s
                    instantly intuitive yet endlessly engaging — a puzzle experience unlike any other on the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We launched JigSolitaire with a clear vision — to create a free, accessible, and beautifully
                    designed puzzle game that anyone can enjoy. Whether you&apos;re a student taking a study break, a
                    professional unwinding after work, or a parent looking for screen time that&apos;s actually
                    beneficial for your kids, JigSolitaire has something for you.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that puzzle games are more than entertainment — they&apos;re tools for building
                    cognitive skills, improving focus, and finding moments of calm in a busy world. Our mission
                    is to make high-quality puzzle experiences freely available to everyone, everywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every level in JigSolitaire is handcrafted with care. From selecting the perfect images to
                    fine-tuning the difficulty progression, we obsess over the details so you can simply enjoy
                    the puzzles.

                <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional jigsaw apps, JigSolitaire uses a unique tile-swapping mechanic. Instead
                    of fitting irregular pieces together, you work within a clean grid — dragging and dropping
                    tiles to swap their positions. When adjacent tiles are in their correct spots, they merge
                    into a group that moves together as one. This creates a satisfying cascade effect as you
                    solve the puzzle.
                </p>
