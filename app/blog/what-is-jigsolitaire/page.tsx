                <p>
                    If you&apos;ve ever loved the satisfying click of a jigsaw piece snapping into place, or the
                    strategic planning of a solitaire card game, JigSolitaire is the game you&apos;ve been waiting
                    for. It takes the best elements of both genres and creates something entirely new — a
                    tile-swapping puzzle experience that&apos;s both relaxing and mentally stimulating.
                </p>

                <h2>The Concept</h2>
                <p>
                    At its core, JigSolitaire is deceptively simple. You&apos;re presented with a grid of tiles —
                    each one a piece of a larger image that has been scrambled. Your job? Drag and drop tiles
                    to swap their positions until the original image is restored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional jigsaw puzzles where pieces have irregular shapes that physically fit
                    together, JigSolitaire uses a clean grid system. This makes the game accessible to
                    everyone while adding a strategic layer — you need to think about the most efficient
                    sequence of swaps, exercising your spatial reasoning and planning skills.
                </p>

                <h2>What Makes It Unique</h2>
                <p>
                    Several features set JigSolitaire apart from other puzzle games:
                </p>
                <h3>Intelligent Tile Merging</h3>
                <p>
                    The most distinctive feature is the tile merging system. When you place two adjacent
                    tiles in their correct positions, they automatically merge into a group. This group
                    then moves as a single unit. The merging mechanic provides the same satisfaction as
                    snapping physical jigsaw pieces together, while the progressive simplification as
                    groups form creates a sense of building momentum.
                </p>
                <h3>Progressive Difficulty</h3>
                <p>
                    Start with a gentle 3×3 grid (just 9 tiles) and work your way up to a challenging 3×5
                    grid (15 tiles). The progression is designed to keep you in what psychologist Mihaly
                    Csikszentmihalyi calls a &ldquo;flow state&rdquo; — where the challenge matches your skill level,
                    keeping things interesting without becoming frustrating.
                </p>
                <h3>Beautiful Imagery</h3>
                <p>
                    Each level features a carefully selected image from one of five categories: Animals,
                    Nature, Cities, Art, and Food. The images aren&apos;t just backdrops — they&apos;re integral to
                    the experience. Recognizing color patterns and visual elements within the tiles is key
                    to solving each puzzle efficiently.
                </p>

                <h2>The Cognitive Benefits</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond entertainment, tile-swapping puzzles engage multiple cognitive systems simultaneously.
                    Research in cognitive psychology has shown that spatial puzzle games exercise visual-spatial
                    processing, working memory, and executive function — the cognitive skills involved in planning,
                    decision-making, and flexible thinking. A study by Levine et al. (2012) found that early
                    puzzle play is a predictor of later spatial reasoning ability.
                </p>

                <h2>Who Is It For?</h2>
