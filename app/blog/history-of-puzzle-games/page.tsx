                    Every time you pick up a puzzle piece or flip a card in solitaire, you&apos;re participating
                    in a tradition that spans centuries. The history of both jigsaw puzzles and solitaire
                    games is a fascinating journey through education, entertainment, technology, and human
                    ingenuity. Here&apos;s the story of how two beloved game types evolved — and eventually
                    merged in games like JigSolitaire.
                </p>

                <h2>The Birth of the Jigsaw Puzzle (1760s)</h2>
                <p>
                    The jigsaw puzzle was born in London around 1760, when cartographer John Spilsbury had
                    a brilliant idea: he mounted a map of the world on wood and cut along the borders of
                    each country. He called them &ldquo;dissected maps&rdquo; and sold them as educational tools for
                    teaching geography to children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For decades, these puzzles remained educational aids for the wealthy — each one was
                    hand-crafted and expensive. It wasn&apos;t until the early 1800s that manufacturers began
                    creating puzzles for entertainment, featuring scenes from nature, literature, and
                    daily life.

                <h2>The Rise of Mass-Produced Puzzles (1900s)</h2>
                <p>
                    The early 20th century changed everything. The development of die-cutting technology
                    allowed puzzles to be produced from cardboard using metal dies, dramatically reducing
                    costs. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, jigsaw puzzles experienced a golden
                    age — they were inexpensive entertainment that could be shared and reused.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the puzzle&apos;s peak popularity in 1933, Americans were buying an estimated 10 million
                    puzzles per week. Companies gave away puzzles as promotional items, and puzzle exchange
                    clubs sprang up in neighborhoods across the country.
                </p>

                <h2>Solitaire: A Royal Pastime</h2>
                <p>
                    The history of solitaire (also known as &ldquo;patience&rdquo;) is murkier, but the game likely
                    originated in Northern Europe during the mid-18th century. Some historians trace it to
                    Scandinavia, while others point to Germany or France. The first written reference
                    appears in a German game anthology from 1783.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Napoleon Bonaparte was famously depicted playing solitaire during his exile on
                    Saint Helena, and the game became associated with contemplation and strategic thinking.
                    Queen Victoria was also known to enjoy patience games, cementing their reputation as a
                    respectable pastime.
                </p>

                <h2>The Digital Revolution (1990s)</h2>
                <p>
                    Both puzzles and solitaire were transformed by computers. Microsoft&apos;s inclusion of
                    Solitaire in Windows 3.0 (1990) was a masterstroke — officially included to teach users
                    how to use a mouse through drag-and-drop, it became the most-played computer game in
                    history. By some estimates, office workers spent over 60 billion hours playing
                    Microsoft Solitaire.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Digital jigsaw puzzles followed in the late 1990s, as web technologies made interactive
                    browser games possible. These early versions were basic — simple click-and-place
                    mechanics — but they opened the door for innovation.
                </p>

                <h2>Modern Puzzle Innovation</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, puzzle games have evolved far beyond their origins. Mobile games like Monument
                    Valley blend puzzles with art. Competitive speedrunning communities have formed around
                    solving puzzles in record times. And hybrid games like JigSolitaire merge different
                    puzzle traditions to create new experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tile-swapping mechanic that JigSolitaire uses is itself a descendant of the
                    classic 15-puzzle, invented by Noyes Palmer Chapman in 1874. This sliding puzzle —
                    with 15 numbered squares in a 4×4 grid — became one of the biggest toy crazes of the
                    19th century. JigSolitaire replaces numbers with image tiles and adds the satisfying
                    merge mechanic, creating something simultaneously familiar and fresh.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Puzzles Endure</h2>
                <p>
                    Through wars, economic crises, technological revolutions, and cultural shifts, puzzles
                    have endured because they tap into something fundamental about human nature: our love
                    of pattern, order, and the satisfaction of solving problems. From Spilsbury&apos;s dissected
                    maps to JigSolitaire&apos;s digital grids, the core appeal remains the same.
